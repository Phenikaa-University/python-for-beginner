### What you'll learn

- The basics of Python
- Common syntax
- Popular packages

## Prerequisites

- Nothing

## Courses

### Getting started

[Python for beginners](https://aka.ms/pythonbeginnerseries) is the perfect starting location for getting started. No Python experience is required! We'll show you how to set up [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) as your code editor, and start creating Python code. You'll see how to manage create, structure and run your code, how to manage packages, and even make [REST calls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer).

### Dig a little deeper

[More Python for beginners](https://aka.ms/morepython) digs deeper into Python syntax. You'll explore how to create classes and mixins in Python, how to work with the file system, and introduce `async/await`. This is the perfect next step if you're looking to see a bit more of what Python can do.

### Peek at data science tools

[Even more Python for beginners](https://aka.ms/evenmorepython) is a practical exploration of a couple of the most common packages and tools you'll use when working with data and machine learning. While we won't dig into why you choose particular machine learning models (that's another course), you will get hands-on with Jupyter Notebooks, and create and test models using scikit-learn and pandas.


## Next steps

- Let's do your own project, find a basic research direction, and really write an application for research labs, you create an environment with Anaconda, find yourself an environment for yourself to be able to develop thinking and professionalism.
